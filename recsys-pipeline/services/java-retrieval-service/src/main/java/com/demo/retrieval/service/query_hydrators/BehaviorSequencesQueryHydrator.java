 *
 * The sequence holds every behavioral action a user took — searches included — so this
 * adapter keeps only the ones that name an item the user showed intent toward, and drops the
 * empty sentinel a search occupies to keep the columnar rows aligned.
 *
 * The first slice deliberately writes into the existing {@code watchedMovieIds} view rather
 * than adding a field to the public query, so nothing downstream has to change to benefit.
 * Selected by {@code recsys.sequence.mode}, the same switch {@link RatingSequencesQueryHydrator}
 * reads:
 *   off    — legacy watched history only, no read at all
 *   shadow — read and log the comparison, still serve legacy
 *   on     — behavior history first, then legacy, de-duplicated and bounded
