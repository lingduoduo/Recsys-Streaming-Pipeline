/**
 * Serving's own feedback events, shaped exactly like the click events the Python producers emit.
 *
 * OnlineJoinerStreamingJob.buildTrainingSamples derives label purely from event_type:
 * clicked = max(etype == "click"), ordered = max(etype in ("order","purchase")), and
 * label = ordered ? 2.0 : clicked ? 1.0 : 0.0. This emits a click event when clicked, an order
 * event when FeedbackRequest.ordered() is true (see build() for why an order always brings a
 * click along), and nothing when neither signal is set. The joiner does read
 * rating, negative_feedback_reason, dwell_millis and completion_rate off feedback events
 * (OnlineJoinerStreamingJob.scala's latestFeedback), but they are deliberately not emitted here:
 * FeedbackRequest carries all four, so this is not a data-availability gap: none of them affects
 * label, and emitting them would be scope nobody asked for, so a serving-sourced sample simply
 * carries nulls in those columns.
 *
 * session_id is also deliberately omitted. The joiner aggregates it with
 * first(col("session_id"), ignoreNulls = true), not gated on isImpression, so a fabricated value
 * here would make the sample's session_id nondeterministic depending on event ordering; a null
 * loses to the impression event's real session_id under ignoreNulls.
 *
 * requestId is a parameter rather than request.requestId() because the caller
 * (HybridRecommendationService.recordFeedback) has already resolved which id joins to the
 * impression: serving's own requestId when the client sent one, otherwise the one recovered from
 * the pending replay context. This class only shapes the event; it does not choose the id.
 *
 * position is not meaningful here: FeedbackRequest carries no slate index, and
 * OnlineJoinerStreamingJob.buildTrainingSamples only reads position off impression events
 * (max(when(isImpression, col("position")))), never off feedback ones. 0 is a placeholder, not a
 * claim about where in the slate this item sat.
